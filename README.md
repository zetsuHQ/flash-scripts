My functional and poorly-written scripts.

---

This repo is designed to keep track of scripts I've written throughout my journey. None of them aim on following it's languages best practices or being completely fool-proof. Most of them will had unique goal of getting the job done, in my own environment, under my own conditions, at the time they were written. Given these circumstances, it's advised that they should not be taken as example for solutions in critical scenarios.
